.DESCRIPTION
    The configuration is spcified by the mandatory parameter $ConfigurationId.
    This defines the Doxygen file containing the configuration options for
    generation, which is simply ($ConfigurationId).dox, as well as the path 
    where the documentation is generated (generated/($ConfigurationId)/html,
    or in case that sources are included, similar path starting with
    "generated_with_sources").
    The output path must be specified in the corresponding .dox configuration 
    file, and must respect the above agreement. This includes inclusion of
    sources in the generated configuration, in which case the documentation
    must be generated in the direectory "generated_with_sources" rather than
    "generated".
    This script is usually run by another script, which is created for 
    generating a specific documentation. Examples are generate_test.ps1
    and generate_test_with_sources.ps1, which are aimed for testing. That
    script must provide correct parameter to this script, and it usually
    enables modifyig default values by explicitly specifying the parameters of
    that script, which have the same names as the corresponding parameters of
    this script.
    Boolean parameters are declared as [bool] rather than [switch], in order
    to make easier to specify parameters via variables or parameters of the
    calling script.

.PARAMETER ConfigurationId
    Mandatory (exception is thrown if not specified). It specifies the
    configuration (a .dox file with the same name as the configuration ID)
    according to which the documentation is generated, which in turn 
    determines the location where the documentation is generated. If the 
    documentation includes source files, this location is 
    generated/($ConfigurationId)/html, otherwise it is
    generated_with_sources/($ConfigurationId)/html.

.PARAMETER IsSourcesIncluded
    Specifies whether sources are included or not. This is informative 
    parameter, but it is relevant when launch of the documentation is
    requested after generation, because knowledge of this parmeter value is
    necessary to determine the location of generated documentation.

.PARAMETER ForceUpdates
    If true then the repository containing the binaries necessary for 
    generation of documentation is updated evn if its clone exists at the
    expected location. Default is false.

.PARAMETER LaunchDoc
    If true the the index of generated HTML documentation is shown in the 
    default web browser after successful generation. Default is true, which 
    should be overridden when documentation is generated in the CI/CD pipeline.   
    
.EXAMPLE
    .\GenerateCodeDoc.ps1 -LaunchDoc 1

    Clones or updates the repo in C:\Repos\Example, using the default remote name 'origin',
    and prints status messages to the console.
