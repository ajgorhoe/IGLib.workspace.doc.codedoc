# Learn C# Basics - Code Documentation Generation Tools

This branch (`swrepos/LearnCsharp/repoMain`)of the [codedoc repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.doc.codedoc/tree/swrepos/LearnCsharp/repoMain) contains tools for **generating code documentation** that are adapted **for the [LearnCsharpBasics repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/LearnCsharpBasics)**.

Other branches (for specific features, fixes, etc.) can be branched off this branch and merged back afterwards.

The documentation generation directory is located in the **`doc/codedoc/`** subdirectory of the container repository, where it is cloned or updated by running the `doc/UpdateRepo_codedoc.ps1` script. The script clones the repository and checks out the above mentioned main repository branch, or updates the repository if it is already cloned.
