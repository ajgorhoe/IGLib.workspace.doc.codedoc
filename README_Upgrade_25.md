# GrapUpgrade of Configuration Files, December 2025

Upgrade was performed on the `codedoc` repository's branch `swrepos/GrLib/NewBinaries25`, which was branched off the branch `swrepos/GrLib/repoMain`. These adaptation branches are used for the [iglibmodules container repository](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/iglibmodules/tree/swrepos/GrLib/repoMain), adapted for container of 3D graphics librarieson the *repository branch* `iglibrepo/IGLibCore/repoMain`. See `codedoc` branches [swrepos/GrLib/repoMain](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.doc.codedoc/tree/swrepos/GrLib/repoMain) and [swrepos/GrLib/NewBinaries25](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/IGLib.workspace.doc.codedoc/tree/swrepos/GrLib/NewBinaries25).

In December 2025, a new repository with Doxygen and Graphviz binarias was prepared, the **[codedoc_resources_25_12](https://github.com/ajgorhoe/codedoc_resources_25_12)**.
