This directory contains copies of some scripts from the IGLibScripts
repository, which are used to botstrap the scripts necessary for updating
module repositories. These scripts are normally used to clone or updated
the repository IGScript.

From time to time, these scripts might be updated.

REMARK:
Scripts in IGLibScrits can always be updated to their newest versions by
calling BootStrapScripting.bat, which will update scripts from their Git
repository.
At the same time, content of IGLibScripts is also part of the containing
codedoc repository, and if scripts are updated via BootStrapScripting.bat,
the updated scripts can be committed to this reepository.
