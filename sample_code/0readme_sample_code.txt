This directory contains some sample code modules, which are used for test
generation of code documentations (using the script ../generate_test.bat 
or ./generate_test_with_sources.bat).

The sample code comes from Git repositories that are accessible on the web,
and can be updated to newer versions by using the appropriate update scripts
(UpdateMotule_*.bat).
At the same time, the code is also committed in the containing codedoc/
repository, such that it can be used when one does not have access to 
these repositories.

The code modules contained here are small, such that generation of test
code documentation is fast and can be used for testing and troubleshooting
of configurations and scripts involved in generation of code documentation.
