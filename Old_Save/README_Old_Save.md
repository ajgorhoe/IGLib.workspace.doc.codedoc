# Old_Save/ Directory

This directory contains some original scripts and configurations from the main branch, such that the new ones can be compared by file comparison
tools. 

This makes possible to quickly see where the differences are and which sections need to be adapted when customizing scripts for a different repository.

With configuration files (.docx), another approach to quckly find locations that may need to be modified is to compare two most distinct configuration files from a group, such as `DocIGLib.dox` and `DocIGLibAllWithSources.dox`.
