
TO DO:
Currently the generate_g3adapter.bat and generate_g3adapterall.bat generate 
documentation with sources. This should be changed back.
The generate_g3adapterall.bat is not generating graphical class hierarchy. Try
to fix this, then also fix the scripts for generation with source files (the
easiest way might be copying and changing files that work).


Starting another documentaion here - for g3 adapter.

WARNING - IMPORTANT - running doxygen directly:
  When running Doxygen directly (not through scripts and passing only the
  configuration file), directories where generated documentation is put
  must already exist (Doxygen will not create it and will exit with 
  unrelated error message if the directory does not exist).
  Logs will give you better information that console output if Doxygen 
  fails.
IMPORTANT:
The following things must match for each kind of documentaion:
  * Environment variable ConfigurationID set in the generation script
  * Name of Doxygen configuration file
  * Name of output directory in the above file, under OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

Location: .../workspace/doc/codedoc/

This directory contains source code documentation that is generated by Doxygen.

In order to update (re-create) documentation, run one of the configuration
files with Doxygen, e.g.

  $ doxygen iglib.dox

You van edit configuration files by any text editor, or by a GUI-driven
configuration tool (doxygen graphical front end) named doxywizard, e.g.

  $ doxyvizard iglib.dox

Use of doxywizard is not very recommended, however, especially not to correct  path information.

Note that the $ sign only indicates command shell's prompt and is not part of  what you type in.
