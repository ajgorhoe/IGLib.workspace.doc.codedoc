
WARNING - IMPORTANT - running doxygen directly:
  When running Doxygen directly (not through scripts and passing only the
  configuration file), directories where generated documentation is put
  must already exist (Doxygen will not create it and will exit with 
  unrelated error message if the directory does not exist).
  Logs will give you better information that console output if Doxygen 
  fails.


Location: .../workspace/doc/codedoc/

This directory contains source code documentation that is generated by Doxygen.

In order to update (re-create) documentation, run one of the configuration
files with Doxygen, e.g.

  $ doxygen iglib.dox

You van edit configuration files by any text editor, or by a GUI-driven
configuration tool (doxygen graphical front end) named doxywizard, e.g.

  $ doxyvizard iglib.dox

Use if doxywizard is not very recommended, however, especially not to correct  path information.

Note that the $ sign only indicates command shell's prompt and is not part of  what you type in.
